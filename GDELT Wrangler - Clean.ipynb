    "One of the challenges of dealing with [GDELT](http://gdeltproject.org/) is that its size makes implementation in a SQL database challenging. It is easier (although slower) to extract a subset of the data that we wish to work with, and do our actual data investigation afterwards. If we're interested in data broken down by date, we have it easy: GDELT files are provided this way. If instead we want to look at a single country, we have some work to do. This notebook parses through each of the GDELT files, one at a time, extracts the relevant lines, and exports them again to a smaller set of csv files. It then gives the option to load these files into a Pandas DataFrame, pickle the result, and remove the intermediate files.\n",
